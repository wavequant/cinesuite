# 🎞️ CineSuite - All-in-one Windows/MacOS app to get the Cinestill look

CineSuite is a free and open-source **Python-based photo effects app** that lets you add realistic **vintage/film-style effects** to your images. Whether you're recreating the iconic Cinestill **halation glow**, adding **film grain, dust, light leaks**, or giving your photos a **classic film border**, CineSuite gives you full control with many adjustable settings.  

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Cinestill Halation** – Recreate the red glow effect seen in Cinestill film.  
- **Film Grain** – Simulate fine or coarse, monochromatic or color film grain for a realistic analog look.
- **Film Borders** – Add authentic 35mm and medium-format film borders, as well as basic color borders.  
- **Light Leaks & Vignetting** – Introduce artistic light flares and darkened edges.  
- **Synthetically Generated Dust** – No overlays! Dust and hair particles are **algorithmically generated** in a super-realistic way.  
- **Color Fringing** – Subtle chromatic aberrations for extra realism.  
- **Batch Processing** – Apply effects to an entire folder of images with one click.
